## WEB101 Astro Weight Calculator

The Astro Weight Calculator is where I first learned how to traverse the DOM, and was also my first real project. My learning objective was to learn how to select DOM elements and add functionality to them using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You simply enter your weight, select a planet, and the page will output your weight as if you were on that planet.
